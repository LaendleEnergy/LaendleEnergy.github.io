**Project idea** (21.09.23)

*Author*: Bianca

Further procedure:
- Define application scenarios
- Define requirements
- Define target group (Who are we doing this for?)
- Create 1-2 proto-personas
- Create paper prototype

**User stories** (12.10.23)

*Author*: Bianca

*Proposal*: The original idea was to set sliders on an energy consumption curve to indicate which device was used in a particular curve. Recommended was to do this the other way around, so to first start a device and then record its usage so that the system immediately learns which device has which consumption. This procedure is recommended because it might make more sense in terms of usability, but it does not have to be implemented this way.

*Recommended further use cases*:
- Notes on the energy efficiency of the appliances in question: e.g., "Your hair dryer uses x kWh, which is y kWh more than the average hair dryer needs" or "If you replace this appliance with this appliance, you could save yourself x kWh"
- Problem detection based on the collected data for a device would add some practical value to the application. One example for this would be to monitor energy consumption of a washing machine. If it uses more electricity then usual, it might be calcified.
- Suggestions on when to turn on which devices, like e.g. "PV system brings x electricity right now so it would be reasonable to turn on applicance y now", or turn on washing machine in 3h.

**Data model** (16.11.2023)

*Author*: Dominik

- Separate DeviceId and household
- SmartMeter as a separate entity (MeterIndividual, instance of a meter)
  - Theoretically, a household can theoretically have several SmartMeters
  - SmartMeter type as an attribute (e.g. Kaifa)
- Measurement is a MeterReading
  - Can have several property values
  - Has a unit, date, numerical value
  - "Original can be left in a first step"
- Encode address according to ISO 19160-4-2017 Address Standard
- Add user contact data (email, number, ...)
- Admin not as a subtype of User but as a role of User
- Contextual role
- Revise measurement-label connection
- Labeling is "sufficient" for our team
- Look at multi-tenant handling
-  "Does each household get its own database or a separate schema in a database or does all data end up in one database?"
-  Look at partitioning at timescale
- Strategies:
  - One table and partitioning
  - Multiple tables within one schema
- Disadvantage: Cannot be distributed to different computers because they all have one schema
  - A separate schema with separate tables for each user
- Disadvantage: Still everything on one database
  - Each user gets their own database
- Link via foreign data mapper
- Master databases
- Labels without a time period "don't hurt"
- Describe in the documentation what is meant by the individual entity types
- Check what kind of model this is


### 1.3. Advanced data analytics (Sebastian Hegenbart) <a name="sebastian"></a>

**Labeling** (16.11.2023)

*Author*: Bianca

- Concept for simultaneous labeling? Possibly work out over time when what is running
- Noisy data will be a problem ïƒ  questionable how much ML is possible in a meaningful way; do not rely on it
- 2x already started washing machine ïƒ  Predict from experience how long the machine will run
- Store 1-n labels for each measured value ïƒ  probably too inefficient; consider whether only the start and end should be recorded
- Incorporate the option to edit the data (labels) retrospectively


### 1.4. UI (Walter Ritter) <a name="walter"></a>

- Labeling page:
   Label name: "Assign consumption"
   Color the curve / area when selecting the time period so that consumption is easier to see

  - Delete account stands out too much as a subordinate buttonï‚§ Perhaps only as a text link with color coding (no red!)o Group data between account, contact and household dataï‚§ On the same or a separate page?- Current members pageo Highlight optional fieldso Rename to household members instead of just memberso Highlight household members and profile difference
- Create your own profile
  - More information

**Microservices** (02.11.2023)

*Author*: Bianca

*Preparation:*
- Own database for Data Preparation Service?
- ML service -> read only to time series database or own DB?
- Does it make sense to split the microservices in the way we did?
- When to use REST/events?

*Documentation:*
- Consideration: Link measurement to the user?
  - Child consumes so and so much power while playing with toy x
  - Answer questions such as: how much more electricity does it need if you have 1-3 children?
- Data Collector & Data Preparation very closely coupled (Data Preparation always accesses Data Collector), possibly ML service later too
  - Data Preparation Service should not always fetch all data from DB -> becomes a lot if you get new data e.g. every 5 seconds
  - Suggestion: merge (if synchronous) or use CQRS (asynchronous, create new view) 
    - Advantage of CQRS: if Data Collector is down, something can still be displayed
  - Data Preparation Service should aggregate data immediately
    - Note: See what Timescale can do, not in the frontend (use hypertables)
  - E.g. also precalculate data for the predefined time periods (annual, monthly, weekly, daily)
  - Build exactly the views for the specified use cases
- Ideally: each microservice = 1 team
- Consider performance and availability (possibly perform load test, look at caching layer at timescale)
- Data Preparation to Data Collector: Work with events (if you separate them at all; see what Timescale can do)
- Events are preferable, but are more complex
- REST only if it is not so bad if a service on which you depend fails (pay attention to the specific requirements)
- CAP theorem for the DB (only two can be fulfilled)- Play through user stories (to which microservice does the request go, which microservices are involved, ...)
- Play through user stories (to which microservice does the request go, which microservices are involved, ...)
- 4+1 scheme (1 = scenarios): Based on this scheme, think about what is necessary

## 2. Technical documentation <a name="technical"></a>

### 2.1 CI/CD & DevOps <a name="devops"></a>
*Author*: Felix

Every Project, which should be deployed for its own, resides on its own Azure
DevOps Project. Those Azure DevOps Projects are holding at least two
Repositories. The first Repository holds the Project itself, the second Repository
holds the deployment definition:

```
Azure DevOps Projects/
â”œâ”€ DataCollector/
â”‚   â”œâ”€ DataCollector/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ project files etc.
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ azure-pipeline.yaml      -> builds & pushes Dockerimage
â”‚   â”œâ”€ Timescale/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ Dockerfile
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ azure-pipeline.yaml      -> builds & pushes Dockerimage
â”‚   â”œâ”€ DataCollector.deployment/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ docker-compose.yaml      -> references Images & defines Deplyoment
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€ azure-pipeline.yaml      -> docker compose up
```

If one Project builds up of multiple separate Components (eg. Application &
Database), there are Repositories for every Component. Every Component has its
own Pipeline, which builds a Dockerimage and pushes that to a Container
Registry.

The Deplyoment resides in its own Repository. In this way, it is possible to
have the Deplyomentdefinition under version control aswell.

### 2.2 Authentication <a name="auth"></a>
*Author*: Bianca

JWT Bearer Tokens are used to authenticate the end user. The front-end application therefore sends an authentication request to the server when logging in, in which the e-mail address and password are transmitted. The password is transmitted in plain text and hashed on the server side. The password is hashed using "PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512" (PBKDF2: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2). Specifically, an HMAC is calculated using the SHA512 hash function. A secret is also taken into account in the calculation. 

The system then checks whether a corresponding account with the same access data exists. If so, a token with a validity of 15 minutes is generated, signed with the private key and sent back; this token must then be sent with every request. In the form of claims, this token also contains further information about the currently authenticated user, namely their ID and household ID. The user's role is also included. A distinction is made here between admin and user. The difference between the roles is that the admin can see and manage the household data. In addition, only the admin can add/remove household members or rewards and delete the household. The advantage of this is that the IDs do not have to be provided with every request to the server, but can be transferred directly via the token and read out on the server side. 

Access to all REST methods is controlled via annotations. This specifies which methods are permitted for which roles. In all methods that require authentication, the system first checks whether a JWT token is available and contains the necessary claims. In addition, the e-mail address of the user within the token is compared with the e-mail address from the security context to ensure that the user who is currently logged in is also the user for whom the token was issued. Quarkus verifies the JWT Token automatically, so no manual check is needed for this.

The main problem with bearer tokens is that they can no longer be revoked. Normally, they only become invalid once the specified validity period has expired. 
Ideally, OpenIDConnect would therefore be used in production, which is based on OAuth2 and can currently be described as the standard for this use case. It could also be used to offer the user the option of logging in via their Google or Facebook account, for which the user would only need to remember one password. But the main advantage is that OpenIDConnect distinguishes between access and refresh token, so the user only has to log in once and one can flexibly handle the period of validity. However, as a separate identity provider would have to be provided for the implementation of OpenIDConnect, the JWT tokens were preferred for this demo project. 

### 2.3 Embedded Device <a name="embedded"></a>
*Author*: Lucas

The embedded device builds the bridge between the smartmeter and the server. Its two main functions are reading the smartmeter data and transmitting it to the server. Goals for the embbeded device were for it to be independed of local infrastructure like wifi or external power. 

#### 2.3.1 MCU <a name="mcu"></a>
The esp32-c3 was choosen as the main computing unit for the embedded device. The main reason for this is the onboard jtag debugger, its cryptrographic features and the low price. Besides this every other microcontroller could be choosen.
An USB-C connector is used to interface the jtag debugger and deliver current to the esp.

#### 2.3.2 MBus <a name="mbus"></a>
The kaifa MA309M smartmeter transmits its data every 5 seconds over and MBus interface. A onsemi NCN5150 is used to translate the signals to 3.3V UART signals with the form 2400Baud, 1 Stopbit and even parity.
The smartmeter can deliver up to 24mA over the two MBus wires. The NCN5150 utilises an internal 3.3V - 15mA regulator to deliver the current to a mcu. In the early design and prototype stage this voltage source was used to power the esp32-c3 and the nb-iot modem and was connected in parallel to the usb power. 
This connection lead to repeating errors in the uart transmission. The following image shows the corrupted data in comparission to correct data. 

![MBus Error](/images/MBus_error.jpg) *Figure 1: MBus Uart data error*

The image reveals errors in every few bytes. This has been confirmed through the use of an oscilloscope. Additionally, the analysis indicates a consistent number of flipped bits, suggesting a potential issue with the internal power regulator of the NCN5150. Upon disconnecting the 3.3V voltage supply from the NCN5150, connected to the esp32-c3 and nb-iot modem, the problem was resolved. It is likely that the support capacitor discharged too rapidly, causing the voltage regulator to fail.

The smartmeter data is packed in four layers. The two lowest ones are the mbus hardware and link layer. The link layer is extended by the "source address" and "destination address" bytes. The mbus payload contains a DLMS/Cosem Frame which is split onto two mbus frames. The DLMS/Cosem payload is encryped with AES-GCM using a 16byte key and the title concatinated with the framecounter as the start-vector. The decrypted payload contains the data in the format of a DLMS "Data Notification" Frame. Since there is no documentation for the exact format the data is parsed by scanning for the OBIS codes and reading the following bytes. 

![MBus Data Format](/images/MBus_frame_format.png) *Figure 2: MBus Frame format*

The frame is parsed from the incomping uart data by scanning for the start (0x68) and length bytes and than reading the rest of the frame depending on the value of the length byte. The address byte is allways 0xFF for this smartmeter showing that the frame is a broadcast and doenst requiere a response. The control-information byte can be 00, 01, 10 or 11 and shows if the paylaod is fractured onto multiple frames with a maximum of 4 frames (0x11).

The relevant parts of the DLMS header are the Title, APDU Length field and the Framecounter. The Framecounter and Title are concatinated and form the star-vector for the decryption. The APDU length field give information about the lenght of the encrypted payload. It can be 1, 2 or 3 Bytes long depending on the first byte. is Its value 0x80 or smaller its the paylaod length, is its exactly 0x81 the next byte is used as paylaodf length and if its 0x82 the next two bytes are interpreted as uint16 payload length. 

#### 2.3.3 Power study <a name="power"></a>
The original goal of for the embedded device was to be completly independed of the local infrastructure. For that it should receive its power over the mbus connections from the smartmeter. As described before the errors occured while powering the esp32-c3 and nb-iot modem from the mbus transceiver. To validate the speculation that the device needs to much current a power study was performed. 

In Figure 3, the power consumption of the embedded device is shown. The supply voltage of 3.3V is turned on around second 1. This initiates the boot process of the ESP32-C3 and the SIM7020E modules. In the time frame of seconds 7-9, the module establishes the mobile network connection. Subsequently, the connection to the server is established, and the authentication takes place. All M-bus messages received up to authentication are then sent to the server. Afterward, the module sends the received M-bus message to the server every 5 seconds. The current is measured using the HMC8015 and read and logged using a Python script. The baseline consumption of the ESP and SIM7020E together is approximately 25mA. Since the M-bus transceiver NCN5150 can only deliver a maximum of 15mA, the ESP32-C3 and SIM7020E must be externally powered. As the average current consumption is around 32mA and an average Li-Ion battery with 2.7Ah lasts only about 84 hours, this option is also ruled out. Theirfor the goal of a completly independent embedded device has failed and it needs to be powered using an external powersupply.

![Embedded Device power study](/images/current_study.png) *Figure 3: Embedded Device power study*

#### 2.3.4 NB-Iot Modul <a name="nb-iot"></a>
NB-IoT was selected for data transmission between the embedded device and the server. The primary rationale behind this choice is to ensure that the embedded device remains independent of local infrastructure, such as WiFi. NB-IoT, in particular, was chosen for its excellent wall penetration and reception capabilities. Unlike alternatives like LoRa or Zigbee, NB-IoT eliminates the need for a gateway that may not be universally applicable in every household.

The SIMCOM SIM7020E Module was chosen to expedite development, leveraging existing knowledge from previous projects. This module interfaces with the ESP32-C3 using a logic-level shifter for the UART lanes. A custom C driver, utilizing the ESP-IDF, was developed for the SIM7020E module. The driver can be easily migrated to other microcontrollers by modifying the UART and GPIO functions in two specific functions, minimizing the required effort.

The driver initializes the ESP32-C3 UART and attempts to communicate with the modem. If the modem fails to respond, the ESP triggers the power key to reset the module. Upon successful communication, the driver initiates the network connection.

#### 2.3.5 Firmware <a name="firmware"></a>

![Firmware](/images/Embedded_Device_Firmware_Overview.png) *Figure 4: Firmware*

#### 2.3.6 Micro Guard UDP <a name="mgudp"></a>
Micro Guard UDP is a specifically developed transmission protocol that enables secure data transfer over UDP. It is designed to fully support the three security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability while optimizing the amount of data.

Confidentiality is ensured through Challenge-Response authentication of the client to the server. The client sends its ID to the server, and the server responds with a 16-byte random number. The client generates the session key from the random number using HMAC and a private key. Subsequently, the random number and the session key are hashed and sent back to the server. The server also generates the session key and hash in the same way to compare with the client's response. If both values match, the client is authenticated on the server, and the server sends an authentication confirmation to the client. To ensure the confidentiality of this response, it is formed by concatenating it with the authentication status using HMAC and the session key derived from the random number. This process is also used for the server's responses to data frames, with the difference that the frame counter is used instead of the random number.

To ensure data integrity, the data is encrypted using AES_GCM. The counter required for this purpose is used as the frame counter and starts at the random number, increasing by the random number % 100 with each data frame.

Availability is achieved through server responses to each frame. To prevent Deauth attacks, the response is concatenated with the current frame counter, and an HMAC is created with the session key. Messages deviating from the HMAC of a potential server response are discarded by the client.

The security of the protocol relies on the private key generated on the embedded device, which must be securely present on the server and linked to the ID.

To achieve small data sizes, metadata is largely omitted. The only exception is the protocol version, which is used to determine the data format. The hashes Server_Response, during authentication, as well as Data_Response, are each truncated to 4 bytes to reduce the amount of data. Thus, the protocol is well-suited for NB-IoT applications.

![Micro Guard UDP](/images/mgudp.png) *Figure 5: Micro Guard UDP*

The server side is implemented in python ontop of udp sockets. The server contains the client state with the ip, port, client key, id, session key and framecounter. Whenever a udp packet arrives at the server a new thread is started to handle the packet. The client state gets choosen by the ip and port. If a packet with a new ip and port arrives the authentication is started. Packets of unauthenticated clients will be ignored. 

#### 2.3.6 Security <a name="security"></a>
To ensure the security of the private key stored on the embedded device, it is generated once and stored in the Digital Signature Module of the ESP32-C3. Consequently, the key is not externally accessible, and the session key derivation can be directly executed within the Digital Signature module.
Due to issues encountered with storing the key in the Digital Signature Module in the current prototype, the key is currently stored in the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) of the ESP.

#### 2.3.7 Hardware design <a name="hardware"></a>
The design is fairly simple containing only 3 major components: 
- MCU: ESP32-C3
  - USB-C Connector
  - LDO: AMS1117
- MBus Trancsceiver: NCN5150
- NB-IoT Modem: SIM7020E
  - Micro Sim Adapter: HYC240-SIM06-150
  - Level Shifter: TXB0104

### 2.4 Testing <a name="testing"></a>
*Author*: Bianca

"Householdmanagement" and "Accountmanagement" have been tested using JUnit5. 

#### 2.4.1 Accountmanagement
Figure 8 shows the testing report of the Accountmanagement service. As we can see, 160 tests have been written for this service. 

![Testing Report - Accountmanagement](/images/test-summary_accountmanagement.png) *Figure 8: Testing Report - Accountmanagement*

## 3. Project progress report <a name="projectprogress"></a>

### 3.1. Sprint 0 (14. - 27. September 2023) <a name="sprint0"></a>
*Author*: Bianca

*Team*: 
Defined **target group** (end users) to be private households with very little technical knowledge, which might not have WLAN reception in the meter room (e.g. basement).

For this, we created a proto persona which is displayed in Figure 12.

 ![Proto persona](/images/ProtoPersona.png) *Figure 12: Proto Persona*

Additonally, following main use cases were defined: 
- Power consumption monitoring
- Power saving hints
- Device identification in form of labeling

---

### 3.2. Sprint 1 (28. September - 12. Oktober 2023) <a name="sprint1"></a>
*Author*: Bianca

*Team*: Application scenarios in form of **user stories** were defined.

*Security*:
- As a user, I want to be sure that my data is stored pseudonymously and transferred securely so that I don't have to worry about possible data theft.
- As a provider, I want to release the AI models only if the user has agreed to release his or her data anonymized to the Open Data Platform API in order to create incentives for data sharing.

*Account Management*:
- As a user, I want to be able to create a household and assign an electricity meter to see the electricity consumption for each of my households.
- As a user, I want to associate a device when I register my account so that I can later collect data for my account.
- As a household, I want to create different profiles for my household with demographic information (age and gender) to assign the different consumptions to the different profiles.
- As a user, I would like to have an application where I can optionally enter my demographic information, such as household size and age of household members, to see more precise comparative values with similar households, if I want to.
- As a user, I would like the ability to delete my account and the data collected, or to decouple the data from the profile.

*Power consumption monitoring/power saving*:
- As a user, I want to be able to see my power consumption (in relative real time) and over the day, so I can estimate what times I needed how much power.
- As a user I would like to set power saving goals and get a report at the end of a set interval if I was able to meet them, to keep an eye on my progress.
- As a user, I would like to receive recommendations for electricity tariffs based on my consumption in order to find the best tariff for me personally and thus save money.
- As a user, I would like to see how much electricity I use on average per day or week so that I have a quick overview of my personal consumption. 
- As a user, I would like to see at a glance how my electricity consumption has changed over the last few days/weeks/months, so that I can see whether I tend to save electricity or not. 
- As a user I would like to see my current consumption translated into the electricity costs for the last 5 / 10 / 20 / ... days (selectable) as a graph on the start page to see if my electricity saving measures are working.
- As a user I would like to get a green info or red warning on the start page, if I could reduce my power consumption in the last 30 days on average, to be motivated to save power when opening the app regularly.
Display of consumption: graphical display of consumed power, possibly annotated with estimated consumption per time with the possibility to correct it. 
- As a user, I would like to receive my power savings target report as a push notification and be able to deactivate it in the settings to be reminded of it if I haven't opened the app for a while.

*Device identification and labeling*:
- As a user, I would like to be notified to label power peaks so that the labels help the evaluation later.
- As a provider, I would like a family leaderboard for labeling to see who labels the most each week to create incentives for labeling.

- As a household manager, I would like to be able to manually set a reward for the leaderboards (free text such as "free pizza", not having to vacuum, ...) to motivate my household to label.
- As a user I would like to have meaningful peak periods pre-selected for labeling to reduce the effort for me.
- As a user, I would like the application to automatically distinguish between my frequently used devices, so that I can better estimate how much power my respective devices require. 
- As a user I would like to see meaningful labels suggested for peaks based on historical data (e.g. washing machine has a peak of 500 watts).
- As a user I would like to see which device needs the most power on average, so that I can save money by using a device with higher energy efficiency instead or by starting the respective device only if necessary.
- As a user, I want to know which devices use how much power on average so that I can initiate changes in consumption to save money if necessary.
- As a user, I want to know when a more energy efficient appliance will pay for itself. 

**Optional use cases**

Additionally, we defined problem detection and comparison with demographically similar households to be interesting use cases, but decided to implement them only if we have enough time.

*Problem and danger detection*:
- As a user, I would like to be notified if an unusually high power consumption has been measured over a longer period of time, so that I can become aware of a possibly defective device.
- As a user, I would like to be informed about possible fire hazards in my power grid so that I can act in time.

*Comparison with demographically similar households*:
- As a user, I would like to be able to compare my personal usage data with comparable households so that I can better assess whether I am using more or less electricity compared to demographically similar households. (Show average value of households as a line and indicate from how many different households this average was calculated).
- As a user, I would like to be able to specify for a household where this household is located, so that the electricity consumption there can be put into relation with the local circumstances.
